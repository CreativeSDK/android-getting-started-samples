# Framework Dependencies

In the Creative SDK for Android, weâ€™ve broken the functionality into smaller dependencies so that developers can include only the pieces that they need, thereby reducing the size of their apps.

_**Note:** Your Client ID must be approved for Production Mode by Adobe before you release your app._

## Dependencies Overview

Below is a table that contains all of the framework dependencies for each feature of the Creative SDK:

|Feature   						|Dependency			  									|

## Adding dependencies to Gradle
To add Creative SDK dependencies to your Android project, open your _Module_ `build.gradle` file and locate the `dependencies` block at the bottom of the file.

In the `dependencies` block, add the Creative SDK dependencies that you need.


### Examples
An example of the correct format for an app using the Creative SDK Image Editor:

```
compile 'com.adobe.creativesdk.foundation:auth:0.9.1186'
compile 'com.adobe.creativesdk:image:4.6.3'
```

An example of the correct format for an app using the Creative SDK Asset Browser UI and Creative Cloud Files API:

```
compile 'com.adobe.creativesdk.foundation:auth:0.9.1186'
compile 'com.adobe.creativesdk.foundation:assetux:0.9.1186'
compile 'com.adobe.creativesdk.foundation:assetcore:0.9.1186'
```
