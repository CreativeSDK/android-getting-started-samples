# Creative SDK v0.9.1186
November 2, 2016

**IMPORTANT:** If you are updating to v0.9.1186 and above, you will need to register a new API Key, Secret and redirectURL from the new [Adobe I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io/integrations).


## Android N (API 24) Support

- The Creative SDK now supports Android N (API 24). This is now the maximum API level supported.
API Keys and Secrets
- Instead of the previous Client ID/Secret authentication, Client Auth for the Creative SDK now requires a new API Key, Client Secret, and unique Redirect URL. These credentials can be generated on the new [Adobe I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io/integrations).

## Redirect URI

- When you register a new Integration or generate new Client Auth credentials for an existing Integration (as mentioned above), you will be given a Redirect URI, which is used as part of the User Auth workflow.
- See our User Auth UI guide for implementation details.

## Image Editor (v4.8.3) updates

- New optional method `quickLaunchTool()` lets you auto-launch a designated tool when the Image Editor is launched.
- New optional method `forceCrop()` lets you require users to crop an image to a specified ratio before making any other edits.
- New `IAdobeAuthRedirectCredentials` interface requirement for your `Application` subclass.

See our Image Editor UI guide for implementation details.
